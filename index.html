                <p>
                    Wherever you've heard people discussing global warming, it is likely you've imagined melting ice and
                    animals like polar bears, penguins, and seals struggling to survive. As the world gets warmer, ice
                    in the Antarctic and Arctic is melting more quickly than ever, threatening these animals greatly.
                    Global warming, though, is not simply something happening far, far away to wildlife in distant lands
                    â€“ it is an international crisis that concerns everyone. As these animals lose their habitats, it
                    leads to collapsing ecosystems that can cause food chains to be disrupted, ocean health to be
                    damaged, and people's food, safety, and economy to be threatened. In this post, I will look into how
                    warming temperatures are injuring these animals and discuss how their struggles relate to the future
                    for humans as well.

                <p>
                    As temperatures rise, Arctic sea ice is melting earlier in the year and refreezing later. Polar
                    bears are losing the sea ice they need to hunt for seals. Without ice, they struggle to find enough
                    food and often starve. Many polar bear populations are shrinking.

                <p>
                    In Antarctica, penguins experience the same challenges. Emperor penguins depend on stable ice to
                    raise their offsprings and to breed. As the ice melts sooner, numerous young penguins are left
                    without a place to survive. The resulting smaller breeding area also increases the pressure on their
                    population.

                <p>Seals also suffer. Many seals give birth on ice platforms. Without stable ice, the young seals are
                    more vulnerable to predation and death by drowning and starvation. As these animals suffer, the
                    entire food chain in polar regions will become unstable.</p>

            <p>
                Katharine Hayhoe makes the point that many people consider global warming to be something apart from
                their own lives. Polar bears live thousands of miles away and appear to have no relationship to their
                everyday
                life. Therefore, it's easy for people to think the melting Arctic and Antarctic ice endangers only the
                creatures living there and has negligible impact on the lives of humans. However, what those animals are
                struggling
                with is actually representative of greater issues that have a direct impact on people around the world.
                The polar regions are key to the Earth's climate system. The melting sea ice raises sea levels and puts
                cities along the coastlines and communities further at risk.

            <p>
                In addition to rising sea levels, polar ecosystem changes also impact global food supplies. Human food
                resources rely heavily on many of the fish found in polar food webs, and when the food webs break down,
                it reduces our food supply and damages the local economies. The same forces of the climate causing the
                melting of Arctic ice also bring more intense heat waves, larger storms, and changing weather patterns
                to many locations worldwide. With the warming Arctic and Antarctic, the ocean currents and weather
                patterns change, resulting in longer droughts, more intense floods, and more intense hurricanes. The
                struggles of these animals are not separate from our own, instead, they are warning signs of bigger
                problems that affect both nature and human life.

                <p> While we are facing greater challenges, there are still many ways for us to take action to help
                    preserve the climate. Governments can enforce tighter regulations to protect the environment and
                    reduce pollution. Businesses can move towards clean power and green practices, such as wind and
                    solar energy. And we individuals can also contribute our power. </p>

                <p> Global warming is not just about rising numbers of temperature, but also relevant about real animals
                    losing their homes, food chains deteriorating, and humans being put at risk. However, if we care,
                    learn, and take action now, we can protect both ourselves and the natural world for a better future.

                <p>
                    When people talk about climate change, we often hear about melting ice and animals like polar bears, penguins, and seals. These animals are in danger because the Arctic and Antarctic ice is melting quickly. But climate change is not just a problem for animals far away. The problems they face affect the whole planet, including us. When animals lose their homes, entire ecosystems break down, and that creates risks for humans too. In this blog, I will explain how warming temperatures are harming these animals and how these changes eventually affect people’s food, safety, and health.

                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Polar Bears</h2>
                <p>As temperatures rise, Arctic sea ice is melting earlier in the year and refreezing later. Polar bears are losing the sea ice they need to hunt for seals. Without ice, they struggle to find enough food and often starve. Many polar bear populations are shrinking.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Penguins</h2>
                <p>In the Antarctic, penguins also face danger. Emperor penguins need stable ice to breed and raise chicks. But as the ice melts, more chicks drown or freeze when the ice breaks up too early. Some scientists estimate that emperor penguins may lose 80% of their population by 2100 if warming continues.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Seals</h2>
                <p>Seals also suffer. Many seals give birth on ice platforms. Without stable ice, pups are more likely to drown, starve, or get hunted more easily. As these animals suffer, the entire food chain in polar regions becomes unstable.</p>

                <p>Other animals, like walruses, krill, and Arctic foxes, are also affected by the changing ice and temperatures. As these species decline, the impacts ripple across entire ecosystems, affecting balance and survival for many creatures.</p>

            <p> At first, these animals may seem far away from us. But the ecosystems they live in are connected to global systems that affect everyone. The Arctic and Antarctic help regulate Earth’s temperature. Melting ice raises sea levels, which can flood cities where millions of people live. </p>

            <p> When polar bears and seals disappear, their prey (like fish and krill) may grow out of balance, which affects ocean food chains. These fish are important not just for polar animals but for global seafood supplies. Many people rely on fish for food and jobs. </p>

            <p> Penguins and seals also help scientists study ocean health. If their populations fall, it’s a warning sign that oceans are in trouble. Warming oceans can reduce oxygen levels and increase dead zones where few animals can live, hurting fisheries and ecosystems that humans depend on. </p>

                <p>
                    Katharine Hayhoe reminds us that sometimes people only care about polar bears because they feel far away and don’t seem to connect to daily life. But the truth is: the same climate forces that melt ice in the Arctic also create heat waves, stronger storms, and rising seas here at home. For example:

                <p>Global warming is not just about numbers or far-away places. It’s about real animals losing their homes, ecosystems breaking down, and humans facing serious risks. But if we care, learn, and act now, we can protect both nature and ourselves for the future.</p>
